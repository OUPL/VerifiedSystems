# CS 6930: Independent Study

## Verified Systems

This graduate independent study examines recent research results in verified systems, with specific focus on verified operating and distributed systems software (e.g., CertiKOS, seL4, Verdi, etc.). The independent study is structured as a graduate seminar: weekly readings together with paper reviews and periodic assignments in which students build and extend existing verified systems. As a final project, students will either implement their own verified system (of moderate complexity) or extend an existing verified system in a nontrivial way.
