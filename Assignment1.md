# Assignment 1

Download and build [seL4](https://github.com/seL4/seL4) running on [Qemu](http://www.qemu.org/) (this may take more time than you think). In class, demonstrate a user program running on seL4/Qemu (perhaps one that makes a system call). Modify the seL4 source code in a way that breaks the correctness proof. Describe the change and resulting proof failure in class.
